GUNNER
=============

This is a 2d game engine that i did code on flash(as3) a long time ago and now i refactored the whole thing into javascript with the html5 canvas tag.

You can test the demo over here: http://dEsteban.github.com/Gunner/


The idea is to build the levels on real time with a json string coming from a server (mongo for example)... there's also an editor in progress. (well, not in progress, but i thinked of it ;P)


Anyway, that's pretty much it.


p.s.: Soon i will drop a few more lines as documentation for the framework and how my lame physics work.. but i think is pretty straightforward.
